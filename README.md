# Tailwind Showcase

- This project was made for the design in this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZc4Jn5nK3k&list=WL&index=5&t=420s)
- The tailwind config file is set up with the colors, fonts and etc. needed for this specific design
- This serves as an introduction to tailwind and shows you'd structure a tailwind project, especially the config file.
